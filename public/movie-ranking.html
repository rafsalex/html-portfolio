    <h1>The best movies according to Rafeeq </h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Alita Battle Angel</h3>
    <p>My favourite female protaganist of all time, highly recomemnded.<br/>
    Made available to all amputees with missing arms, the film producers donated prosthetic arms that look just like the lead character's in the movie! How great is that! I wholeheartedly support films that make everyone feel they are heroes even if they have missing limbs.</p>
    <h3>Avatar</h3>
    <p>One of my favourite sci-fi/fantasy type like movies where politics and cultural misunderstandning leads to war. A spin on learning about alien culture in an unkown planet, a very used cliche but in this movie, well represented.</p>
    <h3>Spirited Away</h3>
    <p>Hands down an anime classic of all time! When I think off the top of my head favourite anime movie, Spirited Away definitely makes it to the top for me.</p>
